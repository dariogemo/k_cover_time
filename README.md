# Cover time and k-cover time of a complete graph

This project aims at demonstrating that the cover time of a complete graph grows as cnlog(n), where c is a constant >0 and n is the graph size.
Also we want to demonstrate that, if you set k = n, the k-cover time of a complete graph grows as clog(n), making the use of parallel random walks k time faster than using a single random walk when visiting all the states in the state space.
